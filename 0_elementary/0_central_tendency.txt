        - in words: ???

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition:
        given:
            6 plants with heights:
                4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7
        then:
            How tall are your plants, given as one number?        
            Ans: average of the heights | typical number | middle number | center number | frequent number 
                 i.e. The central tendency of the numbers.

    - properties:
        - common measures of central tendency(KhanAcademy):
            - Arithmetic Mean = Sum of all numbers/Number of numbers. 
                NB: Human constructed definition we've found useful(unlike the
                circumference of circle, π, etc which exist in the mathematical universe)

                (4 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 7)/6 = 22/6 = 3*4/6 = 3*2/3 NB: In mixed number form
                
                NB: Used frequently
                Key: If the total quantity was distributed evenly in the dataset,
                    the Mean is the quantity that each "position(i.e. index 0,1,2,...n)" would have  (KhanAcademy). 
                    
            - Median = Middle number in the ordered(ascending) version of the dataset. 
                algorithm:
                    If odd number count, take middle number
                    Else even number count, take Arithmetic Mean of the two middle numbers
                    
                
                1, 1, 3, 4, 6 ,7
                    ∴ Median = (3 + 4)/2 = 7/2 = 3*1/2

                0, 7, 50, 10000, 100000
                    ∴ Median = 50

                NB: Useful when some large number might skew the Arithmetic Mean

            - Mode = Most frequent number in the dataset. 
                algorithm:
                    count occurrences of each number
                    find number with highest occurrence count
                        if no single number has the highest frequency, then
                            the dataset has no mode

                1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
                    ∴ Mode = 1

                1, 6, 3, 9, 8
                    ∴ Mode = None
