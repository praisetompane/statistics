## Objectives
- An attempt at unpacking Statistics and its relationship with Computation and Mathematics.

## Definitions
- def statistics¹: tools to understand data (KhanAcademy).

- def statistics²: the science of developing and studying methods for *collecting*, *analyzing*, *interpreting* and *presenting* empirical data (UCI Department of Statistics).

- def statistics types (KhanAcademy):
    - def descriptive: describe large number dataset with a smaller set of numbers
    - def inferential: predict behavior of dataset by determining behavior of a random sample from it.

- Formal Classification Scheme:
  - [ZBMATH](https://zbmath.org/classification/?q=cc%3A62)

- [Theoretical Basis](https://zbmath.org/classification/?q=cc%3A60)
    - [60_probability_theory_and_stochastic_processes](https://github.com/praisetompane/mathematics/tree/main/60_probability_theory_and_stochastic_processes)

## Dependencies
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

## Setup Instructions
- The repository is configured to use [devcontainers](https://containers.dev) for development. <br>It requires no setup except an editor that supports devcontainers, which will prompt you on first open to start it in a container.
